  abstract = {We developed a suite of procedural algorithms for space planning in commercial offices. These algorithms were benchmarked against 13,000 actual offices designed by human architects. The algorithm performed as well as an architect on 77\% of offices, and achieved a higher capacity in an additional 6\%, all while following a set of space standards. If the algorithm used the space standards the same way as an architect (a more relaxed interpretation), the algorithm achieved a 97\% match rate, which means that the algorithm completed this design task as well as a designer and in a shorter time. The benchmarking of a layout algorithm against thousands of existing designs is a novel contribution of this article, and we argue that it might be a first step toward a more comprehensive method to automate parts of the office layout process.},

  abstract = {Urban planning and morphology have relied on analytical cartography and visual communication tools for centuries to illustrate spatial patterns, conceptualize proposed designs, compare alternatives, and engage the public. Classic urban form visualizations \textendash{} from Giambattista Nolli's ichnographic maps of Rome to Allan Jacobs's figure-ground diagrams of city streets \textendash{} have compressed physical urban complexity into easily comprehensible information artifacts. Today we can enhance these traditional workflows through the Smart Cities paradigm of understanding cities via user-generated content and harvested data in an information management context. New spatial technology platforms and big data offer new lenses to understand, evaluate, monitor, and manage urban form and evolution. This paper builds on the theoretical framework of visual cultures in urban planning and morphology to introduce and situate computational data science processes for exploring urban fabric patterns and spatial order. It demonstrates these workflows with OSMnx and data from OpenStreetMap, a collaborative spatial information system and mapping platform, to examine street network patterns, orientations, and configurations in different study sites around the world, considering what these reveal about the urban fabric. The age of ubiquitous urban data and computational toolkits opens up a new era of worldwide urban form analysis from integrated quantitative and qualitative perspectives.},

This paper compares four such strategies, namely, `random', `regular', `proportional-stratified' and `equal-stratified'\textemdash to investigate (1) how they affect prediction accuracy and (2) how sensitive they are to sample size. In order to compare them, a virtual species approach (Ecol. Model. 145 (2001) 111) in a real landscape, based on reliable data, was chosen. The distribution of the virtual species was sampled 300 times using each of the four strategies in four sample sizes. The sampled data were then fed into a GLM to make two types of prediction: (1) habitat suitability and (2) presence/absence. Comparing the predictions to the known distribution of the virtual species allows model accuracy to be assessed. Habitat suitability predictions were assessed by Pearson's correlation coefficient and presence/absence predictions by Cohen's {$\kappa$} agreement coefficient. The results show the `regular' and `equal-stratified' sampling strategies to be the most accurate and most robust. We propose the following characteristics to improve sample design: (1) increase sample size, (2) prefer systematic to random sampling and (3) include environmental information in the design.},

A survey of some commonly used area sampling designs indicates the frequency and extent of this error. Location sampling has remained a poorly understood technique through its confusion with area sampling, and there has been a consequent failure to grapple with the problems of stratifying by location when the primary sampling items are of varying areal extent or are irregularly spaced. An objective method of stratifying by location employing minimal aggregation is described and is used as a basis for both systematic and random samples. Tests on locationally stratified farm sample designs, based upon certain known and hypothetical farm characteristics in one New South Wales shire, indicate that increases in sampling precision obtained through locational stratification are directly related to the levels of spatial segregation in the items being sampled.},

In this study, we describe different paths each type of standardized data takes to construct isoplethic surfaces in a cartographic modeling framework. As suggested in previous research, an area-based pycnophylactic interpolator is preferred to point interpolators in isopleth mapping not only because it preserves the total volume in each aggregation unit but also because it is non-parametric and is able to incorporate ancillary data to increase the accuracy of a surface representation. Here, a general pycnophylactic method is used to generate isopleth maps of density surfaces, but a hybrid approach is proposed to address the small denominator problem that arises when mapping ratio/rate and proportion/percentage surfaces. Finally, we propose a value-by-perspective height mapping procedure to resolve the visual equalization problem associated with ratio/rate and proportion/percentage surfaces that enable one to distinguish among high rate/large denominator, high rate/small denominator, low rate/large denominator, and low rate/small denominator regions of the surface.},

Further, due to the computational cost of a fluid simulation, we train neural networks to assist with accelerating the design process.

  abstract = {THE PERSISTENCE OF THE GERRYMANDER IN NORTH CAROLINA CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING Douglas M. Orr, Jr.* One of the most important special geographic units below the state level is that established for conducting elections. The determination of one type of electoral unit, the congressional district, is a matter of considerable conse\- quence to our federal system of government as manifested in the United States House of Representatives\textemdash ''the grand depository of the democratic principle.'' Yet in our supposedly democratic form of government, congres\- sional districts have traditionally been subject to enormous population disparities and gerrymandering. Political power is rarely surrendered volun\- tarily. A political ``rule of the game'' has been that the party or interest in power apportioned and redistricted so as to stay in power. North Carolina has been no exception. Among its 21 congressional district plans over the past 180 years, including three realignments since 1960, the gerrymander had helped perpetuate the rural domination of the state's congressional delegation, and mor\textsection{} recently, it has been used to try to stem the rising tide of Republicanism and return Democratic incumbents to office. North Carolina therefore provides a meaningful case study as to the persistence of a tactic that has too long prevailed with the nation's political system. GERRYMANDERING. The practice of gerrymandering actually began in Europe, but the term itself originated in 1812 in Massachusetts when Governor Elbridge Gerry carved out an electoral district that was said to resemble a salamander due to its winding shape (Fig. 1). The corruption of the two words gave American politics this descriptive term. This art of political cartography has not been confined to one group or region; both political parties in most parts of the country have practiced it. It represents the manipulation of district boundries in order to juggle district populations for partisan advantage. However, considerable misconception exists con\- cerning the gerrymander. A gerrymandered district may not always be identified by its shape, in spite of the common connotation of the term. The one vote requirement, for example, can be considered an ``anti-gerrymandering '' development because it prevents the inequities of overpopulated and underpopulated districts which were motivated often by party strength in such districts. Yet population equality does not completely prevent gerry\- mandering, although it does restrict partisan maneuvering. The gerrymander may therefore be manifested in several forms, and this art of political abuse has become quite refined by more than a century of *Dr. Orr is assistant professor of geography at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte. The paper was accepted for publication in June 1969. 40 So u t h e a st e r n G e o g r a ph er application in American politics. The several major gerrymandering tech\- niques developed from this experience are summarized as follows: (1) 1. Stacked Districts\textemdash This type of gerrymandered district probably best fits the popular conception of the practice. The ``stacked'' district exhibits the grotesque shape that has inspired the many vivid district descriptions, as it winds its way across the landscape, seeking out pockets of voting strength of one party or interest in an overall area that is predominantly sympathetic to the opposition. Figure 1. The original gerrymander, as depicted in the Boston Gazette of March 26, 1812. The Massachusetts Legislature placed certain towns of Essex County into this odd\- shaped senatorial district in order to concentrate the Federalist vote in as few districts as possible. At firs t described as a salamander, it became known as a gerrymander because Governor Elbridge Gerry signed the redistricting bill into law. Source: Ruth C. Silva, "Reapportionm ent and Redistricting,'' Scientific American, No. 5, November 1965, p. 21. Vol. IX, No. 2 41 2. Excess Votes.\textemdash A popular gerrymandering device is to concentrate the opposition's vote in as few districts as possible so that it is squandered by ``overkill.'' Such planned landslides, also known as ``packed'' districts, insure safe constituencies for a party, but sacrifice votes that might be desperately needed in neighboring districts. Democrats are particularly susceptible to this technique because of the large concentration of traditionally Democratic voters in metropolitan areas. In the South, rural Democrats have ``packed'' districts against urban Democrats. 3. Wasted Votes.\textemdash This...},

More recently, methodological developments, and a greater awareness of the importance of geography, have led to increasingly sophisticated ways to explore varying relationships in land use and transportation modeling. The objective of this paper is to propose a simple probit model to explore contextual variability in continuous-space. Some conceptual and technical issues are discussed, and an example is presented that reanalyzes land use change using data from California's BART system. The results of the example suggest that considerable parametric variation exists across geographical space, and thus underlines the relevance of contextual effects.},

The multiplication formula for triangular numbers was first explicitly described in about the third century AD by the Greek authors Diophantus and Iamblichus.

With a gridded population dataset and geographic boundary of the study area, GridSample allows a two-step process to sample ``seed'' cells with probability proportionate to estimated population size, then ``grows'' PSUs until a minimum population is achieved in each PSU. The algorithm permits stratification and oversampling of urban or rural areas.

These interactions can affect growth rate, recruitment and mortality, and they play a central role in the maintenance of species diversity in these complex ecosystems. Here we use an equal area annulus (EAA) point-pattern method to comprehensively analyze data from two tropical FDPs, Barro Colorado Island in Panama and Sinharaja in Sri Lanka. We show that these NDD interactions also influence the continued evolutionary diversification of even distantly related tree species in these FDPs. We examine the details of a wide range of these interactions between individual trees and the trees that surround them. All these interactions, and their cumulative effects, are strongest among conspecific focal and surrounding tree species in both FDPs. They diminish in magnitude with increasing phylogenetic distance between heterospecific focal and surrounding trees, but do not disappear or change the pattern of their dependence on size, density, frequency or physical distance even among the most distantly related trees. The phylogenetic persistence of all these effects provides evidence that interactions between tree species that share an ecosystem may continue to promote adaptive divergence even after the species' gene pools have become separated. Adaptive divergence among taxa would operate in stark contrast to an alternative possibility that has previously been suggested, that distantly related species with dispersal-limited distributions and confronted with unpredictable neighbors will tend to converge on common strategies of resource use. In addition, we have also uncovered a positive density-dependent effect: growth rates of large trees are boosted in the presence of a smaller basal area of surrounding trees. We also show that many of the NDD interactions switch sign rapidly as focal trees grow in size, and that their cumulative effect can strongly influence the distributions and species composition of the trees that surround the focal trees during the focal trees' lifetimes.},
