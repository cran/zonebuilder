  abstract = {THE PERSISTENCE OF THE GERRYMANDER IN NORTH CAROLINA CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING Douglas M. Orr, Jr.* One of the most important special geographic units below the state level is that established for conducting elections. The determination of one type of electoral unit, the congressional district, is a matter of considerable conse\- quence to our federal system of government as manifested in the United States House of Representatives\textemdash ''the grand depository of the democratic principle.'' Yet in our supposedly democratic form of government, congres\- sional districts have traditionally been subject to enormous population disparities and gerrymandering. Political power is rarely surrendered volun\- tarily. A political ``rule of the game'' has been that the party or interest in power apportioned and redistricted so as to stay in power. North Carolina has been no exception. Among its 21 congressional district plans over the past 180 years, including three realignments since 1960, the gerrymander had helped perpetuate the rural domination of the state's congressional delegation, and mor\textsection{} recently, it has been used to try to stem the rising tide of Republicanism and return Democratic incumbents to office. North Carolina therefore provides a meaningful case study as to the persistence of a tactic that has too long prevailed with the nation's political system. GERRYMANDERING. The practice of gerrymandering actually began in Europe, but the term itself originated in 1812 in Massachusetts when Governor Elbridge Gerry carved out an electoral district that was said to resemble a salamander due to its winding shape (Fig. 1). The corruption of the two words gave American politics this descriptive term. This art of political cartography has not been confined to one group or region; both political parties in most parts of the country have practiced it. It represents the manipulation of district boundries in order to juggle district populations for partisan advantage. However, considerable misconception exists con\- cerning the gerrymander. A gerrymandered district may not always be identified by its shape, in spite of the common connotation of the term. The one vote requirement, for example, can be considered an ``anti-gerrymandering '' development because it prevents the inequities of overpopulated and underpopulated districts which were motivated often by party strength in such districts. Yet population equality does not completely prevent gerry\- mandering, although it does restrict partisan maneuvering. The gerrymander may therefore be manifested in several forms, and this art of political abuse has become quite refined by more than a century of *Dr. Orr is assistant professor of geography at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte. The paper was accepted for publication in June 1969. 40 So u t h e a st e r n G e o g r a ph er application in American politics. The several major gerrymandering tech\- niques developed from this experience are summarized as follows: (1) 1. Stacked Districts\textemdash This type of gerrymandered district probably best fits the popular conception of the practice. The ``stacked'' district exhibits the grotesque shape that has inspired the many vivid district descriptions, as it winds its way across the landscape, seeking out pockets of voting strength of one party or interest in an overall area that is predominantly sympathetic to the opposition. Figure 1. The original gerrymander, as depicted in the Boston Gazette of March 26, 1812. The Massachusetts Legislature placed certain towns of Essex County into this odd\- shaped senatorial district in order to concentrate the Federalist vote in as few districts as possible. At firs t described as a salamander, it became known as a gerrymander because Governor Elbridge Gerry signed the redistricting bill into law. Source: Ruth C. Silva, "Reapportionm ent and Redistricting,'' Scientific American, No. 5, November 1965, p. 21. Vol. IX, No. 2 41 2. Excess Votes.\textemdash A popular gerrymandering device is to concentrate the opposition's vote in as few districts as possible so that it is squandered by ``overkill.'' Such planned landslides, also known as ``packed'' districts, insure safe constituencies for a party, but sacrifice votes that might be desperately needed in neighboring districts. Democrats are particularly susceptible to this technique because of the large concentration of traditionally Democratic voters in metropolitan areas. In the South, rural Democrats have ``packed'' districts against urban Democrats. 3. Wasted Votes.\textemdash This...},

He wrote a Computus or astronomical treatise in Latin in about 814\textendash 16, which contains a chapter on triangular and square numbers. Dicuil describes two methods for calculating triangular numbers: the simple method of summing the natural numbers, and the more complex method of multiplication, equivalent to the formula n(n + 1)/2. He also states that a square number is equal to twice a triangular number minus the generating number, equivalent to n2 = 2[n(n + 1)/2] \textendash{} n. The multiplication formula for triangular numbers was first explicitly described in about the third century AD by the Greek authors Diophantus and Iamblichus. It was also known as a solution to other mathematical problems as early as 300 BC. It reappeared in the West in the sixteenth century. Dicuil thus fills a gap in our medieval knowledge.},
